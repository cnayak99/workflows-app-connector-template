We now run YC four times a year, in the winter, spring, summer, and fall.

They arrive at YC at all different stages. Some haven’t even started working yet, and others have been launched for a year or more. But whatever stage a startup is at when they arrive, our goal is to help them to be in dramatically better shape 3 months later.</p>\n<p id=\&quot;for-most-startups-better-shape-translates-into-two-things-to-have-a-better-product-with-more-users-and-to-have-more-options-for-raising-money\&quot;>For most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money.</p>\n<p id=\&quot;startups-at-all-stages-benefit-from-the-intensity-of-yc-thats-probably-the-best-word-to-describe-the-atmosphere-for-3-months-its-all-startup-all-the-time-everyone-around-youus-the-other-founders-in-your-batch-the-alumni-the-speakers-the-investorswants-to-help-your-startup-succeed-in-that-atmosphere-its-hard-not-to-be-highly-motivated-and-that-kind-of-extraordinary-motivation-is-what-one-needs-to-do-something-as-difficult-as-starting-a-startup\&quot;>Startups at all stages benefit from the intensity of YC. That’s probably the best word to describe the atmosphere. For 3 months, it’s all startup, all the time. Everyone around you—us, the other founders in your batch, the alumni, the speakers, the investors—wants to help your startup succeed. In that atmosphere it’s hard not to be highly motivated. And that kind of extraordinary motivation is what one needs to do something as difficult as starting a startup.</p>\n<p id=\&quot;many-founders-describe-the-11-weeks-leading-up-to-demo-day-as-the-most-productive-period-in-their-lives-though-yc-continues-after-the-3-month-cycle-and-the-alumni-community-is-an-increasingly-valuable-resource-those-11-weeks-are-still-the-most-important-thing-you-cant-make-people-something-theyre-not-but-the-right-conditions-can-bring-out-the-best-in-them-and-since-most-people-have-way-more-potential-than-they-realize-theyre-often-surprised-by-what-theyre-capable-of\&quot;>Many founders describe the 11 weeks leading up to Demo Day as the most productive period in their lives. Though YC continues after the 3 month cycle, and the alumni community is an increasingly valuable resource, those 11 weeks are still the most important thing. You can’t make people something they’re not, but the right conditions can bring out the best in them. And since most people have way more potential than they realize, they’re often surprised by what they’re capable of.</p>\n<p id=\&quot;funding\&quot;><strong id=\&quot;funding\&quot;>Funding</strong></p>\n<p id=\&quot;yc-invests-500000-in-every-company-on-standard-terms-our-500k-investment-is-made-on-2-separate-safes\&quot;>YC <a href=\&quot;https://ycombinator.com/deal\&quot; id=\&quot;invests\&quot;>invests</a> $500,000 in every company on standard terms.

We now run YC four times a year, in the winter, spring, summer, and fall. Here’s what happens during the three months of YC:</p>
<p id="the-goal"><strong id="the-goal">The Goal</strong></p>
<p id="the-overall-goal-of-yc-is-to-help-startups-really-take-off-they-arrive-at-yc-at-all-different-stages-some-havent-even-started-working-yet-and-others-have-been-launched-for-a-year-or-more-but-whatever-stage-a-startup-is-at-when-they-arrive-our-goal-is-to-help-them-to-be-in-dramatically-better-shape-3-months-later">The overall goal of YC is to help startups really take off. They arrive at YC at all different stages. Some haven’t even started working yet, and others have been launched for a year or more. But whatever stage a startup is at when they arrive, our goal is to help them to be in dramatically better shape 3 months later.</p>
<p id="for-most-startups-better-shape-translates-into-two-things-to-have-a-better-product-with-more-users-and-to-have-more-options-for-raising-money">For most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money.</p>

That’s probably the best word to describe the atmosphere. For 3 months, it’s all startup, all the time. Everyone around you—us, the other founders in your batch, the alumni, the speakers, the investors—wants to help your startup succeed. In that atmosphere it’s hard not to be highly motivated. And that kind of extraordinary motivation is what one needs to do something as difficult as starting a startup.</p>

Though YC continues after the 3 month cycle, and the alumni community is an increasingly valuable resource, those 11 weeks are still the most important thing. You can’t make people something they’re not, but the right conditions can bring out the best in them. And since most people have way more potential than they realize, they’re often surprised by what they’re capable of.</p>

Each founder has a profile and can tag themselves as an expert in any topic. If you have a question, need an introduction, or want to poll for knowledge, you can post the request to the forum on Bookface. The knowledge base of the YC community is both broad and deep—the community includes founders who are the world’s foremost experts in everything from security to community building to nuclear energy.</p>

Most speakers are successful startup founders — the founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash and Ginkgo Bioworks often come back to tell the inside story of what happened in the early days of their startups. Talks are strictly off the record to encourage candor, because the inside story of most startups is more colorful than the one presented later to the public.</p>

Often we talk to the investors ourselves, to find out what they’re really thinking about a particular startup. Because YC-funded startups are a known quantity to investors and get introduced to enough of them to create serious price competition, companies tend to get higher valuations than they might otherwise.</p>
